                <li>At the current momenty my goal actually is to find some kind of activity that will be interesting for me and will be work that i like to do. For now i think that programming can be this activity, that's why i'm writing this resume. So about me: i'm kind of responsible person, one of the ability that i like most is my ability to learn fast, i really can digest information from one lesson and i need little experience to work with any information. I can quickly find a common language with different people.</li>
                <li>I'm learning C++ in the university for more than 1 year, that's why i know the main things about it. I know a lot of basic thing such as: sorting and searching alghoritms, recursive functions, the main things in object-oriented programming and some other interesting things. Also before this course i have learned html/css and a bit of javascript.</li>

                <li>I have passed course <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn">here</a> and started a course <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">here</a>.</li>
                <li>I'm studying at the Belorusian State University of Informatics and Radioelectronics on th Faculty of Informational Technology and Control. I have passed some course that i mantioned above.</li>
                <li>I learned English language since i was 6. While learning at i was attending additional English courses for about 7 years. That's why i know English pretty good. For now my English knowledge level is about B2. Also i've been abroad many times and there i spoke fluently with native speakers.</li>
